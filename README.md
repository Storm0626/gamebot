# README
_sharred edditing of the file done through reple and actually running the bot will go through the command line_
_however if you want to test features of your own youll need to install discord.js node.js and some other pacjages_



# installing the required junk

## node js

go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and select your platform
pretty easy

## discord.js
create the folder in which the bot code will be stored
open cmd (the command line)
type in cd <destination> to go into a folder
so if your folder is on the desktop and its named "botcode"
youll first type:
  
cd desktop

then:
  
cd botcode 

you'll be in the bot folder now
from there type this command:

npm install discord.js --save

this will install all the nesisarry packages in that folder
i think you should be set for the most basic of things now all you need is to actually program the bot
or use the index.js file provided in this repo
